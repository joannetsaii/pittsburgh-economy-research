## Pittsurgh Economy Research
Economic research @ Tepper School of Business in Summer 2021. Created an economic newsletter which captures the overview of the Pittsburgh economy, along with graphs and commentaries on the regional macroeconomy, housing market, and labor market. Data cleaning, visualization, and analyses were conducted using R and Microsoft Excel.
