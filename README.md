# Research: Pittsurgh Economy in a Snapshot
Economic research @ CMU Tepper School of Business in Summer 2021. Created an economic newsletter which captures the overview of the Pittsburgh economy, along with graphs and commentaries on the regional macroeconomy, housing market, and labor market. Data cleaning, visualization, and analyses were conducted using R and Microsoft Excel. 

The main focus of this research project was to observe and analyze the changes in both the national and regional economy after the COVID-19 pandemic and extract economic insights.

## Final Product
Co-authored an economic newspaper for Carnegie Mellon Economics. See `Pittsburgh_Economy_in_a_Snapshot.pdf`
